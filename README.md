Usage:
1. View an Item: The item details are displayed with the name, quantity, price, and description. You can toggle between the view and edit modes by clicking the "Edit" button.

2. Edit an Item: In edit mode, modify the details of the item, and then click "Save" to update it. You can also cancel the edit by clicking the "Cancel" button.

3. Remove an Item: To remove an item from the list, click the "Remove" button. This action will remove the item from the shopping list.

Future Improvements:
- Add Validation: Currently, the app doesn't have validation for input fields. Adding validation would improve the user experience.
- Persist Data: Integrating a backend or local storage to persist the shopping list would allow the app to remember the list across sessions.
- Enhanced UI: We can add more interactive elements, such as sorting and filtering the shopping list.
